Developments in these two sectors generate a lot of public interest. On the one hand, there are sentiments that the mining sector does not pay its fair share of taxes, and on the other hand, increasing energy tariffs has financial implications on households and directly impacts on the well-being of citizens.</description>

Introduction This write-up documents the Tembo&amp;rsquo;s Prediction Model for Zambia&amp;rsquo;s 2021 Elections. It focuses on the Presidential elections. The model is built bottom-up from constituency level. At this time, Zambia (in 2021) has 156 constituencies. All the historical and current registration data used in developing this model is obtained from the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ). R programming software (an open source software) was used to simulate different elections scenarios.</description>
